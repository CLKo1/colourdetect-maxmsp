# colourdetect-maxmsp
* A Max MSP bpatcher that compares incoming RGB values to stored values and outputs the name of the closest approximation for what the colour is.
* I initially used it for a TCS34725 RGB sensor. But this bpatcher my be adapted to use other RGB data inputs from a USB camera or video. 
* Inside the bpatcher is an "i" icon. Click that to read more details on how the bpatcher works. 
* Most important thing to remember is you have to sample the colours before you start using the bpatcher.

* If you experience any issues or have any questions, let me know: www.chantelleko.com
